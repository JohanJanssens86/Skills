description: "Implement the result of /to-spec and /to-tickets in code."

You have been provided a spec. This spec should have tickets associated with it, describing how to implement the spec.

The issue tracker should have been provided to you. If not, tell the user to run `/setup-matt-pocock-skills`.

The goal is the entire spec implemented on a single **integration branch**, with every ticket resolved the way the issue tracker closes work.

The tickets are not a list of steps. They are a **task graph** with blocking relationships between them. This means there is always a **frontier** of tickets which are ready to be grabbed.

Communication to and from subagents should be sparse. Communicate primarily through **context pointers**: to the spec, tickets, research notes, and previous commits. Don't duplicate information already available via pointers.

**Implementer subagents** should be run in the background where possible for maximum concurrency.

## Steps

1. Read the spec and tickets to understand the task graph.

2. (optional) Use an **exploration subagent** to conduct any exploration required by the tickets - relevant codebase files or external documentation. Ensure the exploration subagent can save files - it should save its markdown notes in a directory outside the repo, accessible by all future subagents. This lets **implementer subagents** focus on implementation rather than exploration.

3. Create the integration branch. If the issue tracker closes work through PRs, or the user asks for one, open a draft PR after the first merge in step 5 (a branch with no commits ahead of main can't open one), marked as closing the spec and tickets.

4. Use **implementer subagents** to implement each ticket, each in its own worktree on its own branch. Each implementer subagent:
   - confirms its worktree is based on the integration branch before starting; if it is not, uses a clean worktree based on that branch without discarding existing changes;
   - reads [tdd](../tdd/SKILL.md) and follows its instructions to build the ticket, using the seams already agreed in the spec;
   - merges the integration branch tip into its own branch before reporting done

5. Once an **implementer subagent** completes, merge its work to the integration branch with a **merger subagent**.

6. If this changes the **frontier** of available tickets, kick off more **implementer subagents** to work on the new tickets. This allows for maximum concurrency.

7. Once all tickets are complete, read [code-review](../code-review/SKILL.md) and review the integration branch against its recorded starting commit and the originating spec. Fix actionable issues raised by the code review in a single **implementer subagent**.

8. If a draft PR exists, mark it ready for review. Otherwise, resolve each ticket the way the issue tracker closes work, and report the integration branch.

9. Clean up all **implementer subagent** worktrees.

## Codex execution

Read `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` and `docs/agents/domain.md` when present.
Use Codex collaboration tools for subagents. Each implementer must run Git commands
and edits in its assigned worktree directory; subagents otherwise share a workspace.
Use the `codex/` branch prefix unless the user specifies another. Record the
integration branch's starting commit for the final review. Respect the available
agent slots and start further ready tickets as slots become available.
Archive managed worktrees with the Codex worktree tool after their work is merged.
Preserve unmerged work and never discard existing changes to prepare or clean up.
